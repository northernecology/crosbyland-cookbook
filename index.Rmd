## Pickles

### Rhubarb pickls 
On May 25, 2022, I tried my first batch of pickled rhubarb (we have a LOT of rhubarb from only 2 plants in the bakcyard). 

Ingredients: 
* 7 rhubarb stalks, cut in 1 inch pieces  
* 1 big garlic clove, minced  
* 1 Tbsp black peppercorns 
* 1.5 tsp creamed horse radish root
* 2.5% brine solution: 425 grams of water mixed with 10 grams of pickling salt

I put the garlic, peppercorns, and horse radish into the bottom of the jar, and then the rhubarb pieces on top. The rhubarb came almost tothe top of the jar. 

I made the brine with room temperature bottled water from Costco mixed with Roger's pickling salt, and stirred until the salt was dissolved. 

I poured the brine over the rhubarb and it was just enough to cover all the rubarb. I put a half-pint jar on top of everything to keep the vegetables submerged, and secured it all by putting a piece of cheese cloth over the top and securing it to the big jar with a rubber band. 

Now I will wait 2 weeks and see what I get.
