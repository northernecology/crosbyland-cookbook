# About
These are some random trial recipes

## Pickles

### Rhubarb pickles 
On May 25, 2022, I tried my first batch of pickled rhubarb (we have a *LOT* of rhubarb from only 2 plants in the backyard). The recipe comes from [phickle.com](http://phickle.com/spring-pickles-rhubarb-and-asparagus/)

Ingredients:  

* 7 rhubarb stalks, cut in 1 inch pieces  
* 1 big garlic clove, minced   
* 1 Tbsp black peppercorns  
* 1.5 tsp creamed horse radish root  
* 2.5% brine solution: 425 grams of water mixed with 10 grams of pickling salt  


I put the garlic, peppercorns, and horse radish into the bottom of the jar, and then the rhubarb pieces on top. The rhubarb came almost to the top of the jar.  

I made the brine with room temperature bottled water from Costco mixed with Rogers pickling salt, and stirred until the salt was dissolved.  

I poured the brine over the rhubarb and it was just enough to cover everything. I put a half-pint jar on top of everything to keep the vegetables submerged, and secured it all by putting a piece of cheese cloth over the top and securing it to the big jar with a rubber band.  

Now I will wait 2 weeks and see what I get.  

May 31: Everythign looks and smells fine. No mold. I don't see any bubbling in the jar though. 


### Sauerkraut 
On May 29, Sebastian and I made our first batch of sauerkraut together. I had made some years earlier in a bucket (when I lived in Michigan), and that came out really well. This time we used a 1-Litre canning jar and followed the base recipe from [makesauerkraut.com](https://www.makesauerkraut.com/sure-fire-sauerkraut-in-a-jar/). 

We had some trouble using the cabbage leaf trick to do the full submerge. We didn't have a half-pint canning jar, so used a small cup instead. Littel bits of carrot kept floating to the top, and I think some of the cabbage leaf is still not fully submerted. We'll see what happens. 

May 31: Everything looks and smells fine. The cabinet where I'm storing it is definately starting to smell like sauerkraut, and I'm seeing bubbles in the jar.
